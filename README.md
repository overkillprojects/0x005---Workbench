# 0x005---Workbench

Here are some plans for a really cheap, very sturdy workbench:

The top of the workbench is made from four 2x6 studs (I used Douglas fir because it is cheap and straight) cut down to size, in this case at least 4 feet long.  Make sure to choose very straight studs for this.  I rested them sideways on the floor of the lumber yard (leveled concrete) to check them.  They are secured together with wood glue and will be screwed to the frame with L-brackets.  If you will be covering the top with something (anti-static mat, etc.) you can definitely use plywood effectively here.  I am using studs because they look a little better and are still very cheap.

The frame of the workbench is made of 2x4 studs. I used Southern Yellow Pine because it is cheap and relatively heavy and hard.  The framing studs are fastened with 3inch lag screws, two through each end of each beam.

The legs shown here are just single 2x4 studs cut to the appropriate size.  In the video I used 2 each for the legs, making them into 4x4 studs so that I could fasten casters to the bottom to make it a rolling table.  If you do this you need to get the legs cut shorter.  In any case the total height of the bench should be between 32 and 36 inches depending on height and use.  I used lag bolts to secure the legs to the frame.
